After some years working with software I have got to the conclusion that there are three important pillars in my daily work:

1. Technical
2. Business
3. Infrastructure

## Technical

For me it is the most important, but once you start coding is only 1/3 of the pillars required. Here I am talking about stuff like: programming languages, frameworks, principles, patterns and good practices.

## Business

You can be a great programmer but you cannot code a single line of code if you do not understand all the business that surrounds you. Which are the data types and how your product (software) is defined.

## Infrastructure

What is the culture in you company? How do you move things forward, which are the internal tools you need? Which kind of repo and configuration do you require? Permissions?
