JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the **[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)** specification.

JavaScript is:

- **high-level**
- often **[just-in-time compiled (JIT)](#jit)**
- **[multi-paradigm](#js-multi-paradigm)**
- It has **[curly-bracket syntax](#curly-bracket-syntax)**
- **[dynamic typing](#dynamic-typing)**
- **[prototype-based](#prototype-based-programming)** **[object-orientation](#object-oriented-programming)**
- **[first-class functions](#first-class-function)**

## Engine

Most web browsers have a dedicated **JavaScript engine** to execute the code on the user's device.

- **V8 from Google** is the most used JavaScript engine. Google Chrome and the many other Chromium-based browsers use it, as do applications built with CEF, Electron, or any other framework that embeds Chromium. Other uses include the Node.js and Deno runtime systems.
- **SpiderMonkey** is developed by **Mozilla** for use in Firefox and its forks. The GNOME Shell uses it for extension support.
- **JavaScriptCore** is **Apple**'s engine for its Safari browser. Other WebKit-based browsers also use it. KJS from KDE was the starting point for its development.
- **Chakra** is the engine of the **Internet Explorer** browser. It was also forked by Microsoft for the original Edge browser, but **Edge** was later rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and thus **now uses V8**.

## APIs

It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with:

- text
- dates
- regular expressions
- standard data structures
- Document Object Model (DOM)

> The ECMAScript standard **does not** include any **input/output (I/O)**, such as *networking*, *storage*, or *graphics* facilities. In practice, the *web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O*.

### JS Multi-paradigm

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports:

- **event-driven**
- **functional**
- **imperative**

programming styles.

### curly-bracket syntax

Curly-bracket or curly-brace programming languages have a syntax that defines statement blocks using the curly bracket or brace characters `{` and `}`.

### Prototype-based programming

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as **inheritance**) is performed via a process of **reusing** existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming.

### JIT

In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation (also dynamic translation or run-time compilations) is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.

### dynamic typing

Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime.

Programming languages that include dynamic type checking but **not static type** checking are often called "dynamically-typed programming languages".

[See Type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system).

### Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

### First-class function

This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures
